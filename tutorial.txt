How to play:  

Your goal is to try and beat the dealer by having your total  
amount of cards value be closer to 21 than the dealer's cards  

All face cards have a value of 10. Ace has a value of  
1 or 11 depending on if your hand exceeds 21. The rest have  
the same value as the number of the card\n  

You will recieve 2 cards to start with. The dealer will have  
one card facing up and one card facing down. Based on this  
you can make a guess of how many points the dealer might have  
to determine your next move \n 
You have the option to either hit or stand. If you hit  
you will be given another card. If you stand the dealer will  
reveal their hidden card. If the dealer's cards amount  
to less than 17 they have to hit. If their cards amount to  
17 or more they have to stand.\n  

A bust is an automatic loss. This is when your total cards  
exceed the value of 21.\n 
If you bust you lose. If the dealer busts you win.  

At the start of the game you'll place a bet. If you win you  
get double your bet back. \n 
If your two starting cards has a value of 21 you will immediately  
get 1.5x your bet back. This is called a natural blackjack
